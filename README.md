## Description & Requirements

In this assignment, we were tasked with utilizing the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page send Ajax calls to the GIPHY website, and return results based on user input. 


## How it Works
 

1. When the user clicks on a button, the page grabs 5 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and places them on the page. When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif will animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it will stop playing.

2. User's can create their own button by entering their chosen movie into the search bar and pressing submit.

3. Their new button the page will grab 5 more static, non-animated gif images that correlate to their new button.
